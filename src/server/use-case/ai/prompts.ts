export const KEY_FEATURES_PROMPT = `Typography:

Use elegant and modern font families like 'Space Grotesk', 'Bricolage', 'Epilogue', 'Inter', or 'Poppins' as needed.
Ensure proper font sizing for readability (e.g., headings between 18px-24px, body text around 14px-16px).
Apply a balanced line-height for comfortable reading (e.g., 1.5x).
Colors:

Use a modern and visually appealing color palette, such as soft pastels, subtle gradients, or a mix of light and dark tones.
Ensure high contrast for accessibility while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing design.
Use complementary accent colors for buttons, links, or call-to-actions.
Layout:

Create a clean and modern layout with ample white space for clarity.
Incorporate visually distinct sections, such as a header, hero image or banner, body content, and footer.
Include areas for headings, paragraphs, and calls-to-action buttons styled with rounded corners, hover effects, and smooth transitions.
Use grids or columns for well-structured content (e.g., two-column layouts for images and text).
Design Elements:

Add subtle design elements like dividers, shadows, or borders to enhance the visual appeal.
Include responsive design to ensure the email looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
Accessibility:

Ensure the template is accessible with proper contrast ratios, alt text for images, and semantic HTML elements.
Use fallback fonts for email clients that may not support custom web fonts.
Example Content:

A header with a logo and navigation links.
A hero section with a striking headline and supporting text related to the given topic.
A section for showcasing a product, service, feature, or announcement with an image and description.
A call-to-action button styled elegantly (e.g., ‘Get Started’ or ‘Learn More’).
A footer with contact information, social media links, and an unsubscribe option.
